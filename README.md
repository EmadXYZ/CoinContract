---  

## 📜 Overview  

- **Language:** Solidity (`^0.8.26`)  
- **Network:** zkSync  
- **Purpose:** A **simple token** for tracking balances and performing direct transfers.  

---  

## ⚡ Key Features  

✔ **Minting Mechanism** – Only the creator (`minter`) can mint new tokens.  
✔ **Direct Transfers** – Users can send tokens securely without intermediaries.  
✔ **Balance Tracking** – Keeps track of each user's token balance.  
✔ **Gas Efficient** – Optimized for **low-cost transactions** on zkSync.  
✔ **Secure Transactions** – Includes error handling for insufficient balances.

## 🔍 Security Considerations  

- **Controlled Minting:** Only the contract deployer (minter) can create new tokens.  
- **Balance Verification:** Prevents transfers if the sender lacks sufficient balance.  
- **Efficient Storage:** Uses a **mapping-based** balance system for efficiency.
